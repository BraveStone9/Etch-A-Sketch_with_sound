# Etch-A-Sketch_with_sound
Created this for The Odin Project Website.<br>
[Play with it](https://bravestone9.github.io/Etch-A-Sketch_with_sound/EtchSketch.html)<br>
Used some sounds, but didn't had any good sounds, so used Drum Kit sounds.

***Anyone who can provide some pleasants sound to replace the drum kit noise. Please send me a link or audio by creating a issue on this repository***
